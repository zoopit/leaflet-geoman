## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Leaflet-Geoman.

Follow these steps to get up and running:

1.  clone the repository
2.  run `npm install`
3.  run `npm start`
4.  run `npm run cypress` to launch the test suite (also nice for TDD)
5. Launch developing.spec.js, it will open Chrome with a map and leaflet.pm where you can test the changes you make, manually and with the test suite
6. In case you need to write tests for your new feature, create a separate *.spec.js file for your tests or add them to an existing one when appropriate
